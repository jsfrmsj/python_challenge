# Module 3 - Python Challenge

#created a new repository in my personal github for this module called python_challenge

#In the PyBank assignment I created a series of lists to hold the values from which I could draw upon later. Primarily the lists would hold the difference between the rows in column 1. This is how I would be able to calculate the changes in profits and losses. I.E. what is the difference between the profit in one date to the profit in the following date. From there I was able to get the max, min, and average change in profits.

#In the PyPoll assignment I needed a loop to sift through the rows and count how many times each candidates name arose so that I could count how many votes they each got. From there is was simple arthmetic to calculate percentages. Then the person with the most votes won.
